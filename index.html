                Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them,
                users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds. By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial
                world. The only limits to near-real VR experiences are the availability of content and cheap computing power

                        Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are two sides of the same coin. You could think of Augmented Reality as VR with one foot in the real world: Augmented Reality simulates artificial objects in the real environment; Virtual Reality creates an artificial environment to inhabit.
                        In Augmented Reality, the computer uses sensors and algorithms to determine the position and
                        orientation of a camera. AR technology then renders the 3D graphics as they would appear from
                        the viewpoint of the camera, superimposing the computer-generated images over a user’s view
                        of the real world.
                        <br><br>
                        In Virtual Reality, the computer uses similar sensors and math. However, rather than locating a
                        real camera within a physical environment, the position of the user’s eyes are located within the
                        simulated environment. If the user’s head turns, the graphics react accordingly. Rather than compositing virtual objects and a real scene, VR technology creates a convincing, interactive world for
                        the user.
